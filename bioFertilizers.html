    <section id="Introduction">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Organic farming has emerged as an important priority area globally in view of the growing demand for safe and
        healthy food and long term sustainability and concerns on environmental pollution associated with indiscriminate
        use of agro-chemicals. Though the use of chemical inputs in agriculture is inevitable to meet the growing demand
        for food in world, there are opportunities in selected crops and niche areas where organic production can be
        encouraged to tape the domestic export market<br>
        Bio-fertilizers are being essential component of organic farming are the preparations containing live or latent
        cells of efficient strains of nitrogen fixing, phosphate solubilizing or cellulolytic micro-organisms used for
        application to seed, soil or composting areas with the objective of increasing number of such micro-organisms
        and accelerate those microbial processes which augment the availability of nutrients that can be easily
        assimilated by plants. Bio-fertilizers play a very significant role in improving soil fertility by fixing
        atmospheric nitrogen, both, in association with plant roots and without it, solubilise insoluble soil phosphates
        and produces plant growth substances in the soil. They are in fact being promoted to harvest the naturally
        available, biological system of nutrient mobilization (Venkatashwarlu, 2008a). The role and importance of
        biofertilizers in sustainable crop production has been reviewed by several authors (Biswas et al. 1985; Wani and
        Lee, 1995; Katyal et al.1994). But the progress in the field of BF production technology remained always below
        satisfaction in Asia because of various constraints.<br>
        It may be noted, only 30 % of India’s total cultivable area is covered with fertilizers where irrigation
        facilities are available and the remaining 70 % of the arable land, which is mainly rain fed, very negligible
        amount of fertilizers are being used. Farmers in these areas often use organic manures as a source of nutrients
        that are readily available either in their own farm or in their locality. The North- Eastern (NE) region of
        India provides considerable opportunity for organic farming due to least utilization of chemical inputs. It is
        estimated that 18 million hectare of such land is available in the NE that can be exploited for organic
        production. With the sizable acreage under naturally organic/default organic cultivation, India has tremendous
        potential to grow crops organically and emerge as a major supplier of organic products in world’s organic market
        (Venkatashwarlu. 2008a) The report of Task Force on Organic Farming appointed by the Government of India also
        observed that in vast areas of the country, where limited amount of chemicals are used and have low productivity
        could be exploited as potential areas to develop into organic agriculture. Arresting the decline of soil organic
        matter is the most potent weapon in fighting against unabated soil degradation and imperiled sustainability of
        agriculture in tropical regions of India, particularly those under the influence of arid, semiarid and sub-humid
        climate. Application of organic manures particularly bio-fertilizers is the only option to improve the soil
        organic carbon for sustenance of soil quality and future agricultural productivity. </p>
    <h2>Why to explore bio-fertilizers:</h2>
    <p>Indiscriminate use of synthetic fertilizers has led to the pollution and contamination of the soil, has polluted
        water basins, destroyed micro-organisms and friendly insects, making the crop more prone to diseases and reduced
        soil fertility.
    <ol>
        <li>Demand is much higher than the availability. It is estimated that by 2020, to achieve the targeted
            production of 321 million tonnes of food grain, the requirement of nutrient will be 28.8 million tonnes,
            while their availability will be only 21.6 million tones being a deficit of about 7.2 million tones. </li>
        <li>Depleting feedstock/fossil fuels (energy crisis) and increasing cost of fertilizers. This is becoming
            unaffordable by small and marginal farmers. </li>
        <li>Depleting soil fertility due to widening gap between nutrient removal and supplies.</li>
        <li>Growing concern about environmental hazards. </li>
        <li>Increasing threat to sustainable agriculture. </li>
    </ol>
    Besides above facts, the long term use of bio-fertilizers is economical, eco-friendly, more efficient, productive
    and accessible to marginal and small farmers over chemical fertilizers
