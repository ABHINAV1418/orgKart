        <h1>Weed Management in Organic Farming</h1>
        <h2>1. About organic weed management?</h2>
        <p>Farmers have struggled with the presence of weeds in their fields since the beginning of agriculture. Weeds
            can be considered a significant problem because they tend to decrease crop yields by increasing competition
            for water, sunlight and nutrients while serving as host plants for pests and diseases. Since the invention
            of herbicides, farmers have used these chemicals to eradicate weeds from their fields. Using herbicides not
            only increased crop yields but also reduced the labor required to remove weeds. Today, some farmers have a
            renewed interest in organic methods of managing weeds since the widespread use of agro-chemicals has
            resulted in purported environment and health problems. It has also been found that in some cases herbicides
            use can cause some weed species to dominate fields because the weeds develop resistance to herbicides. In
            addition, some herbicides are capable of destroying weeds that are harmless to crops, resulting in a
            potential decrease in biodiversity on farmers. It is important to understand that under an organic system of
            seed control, weeds will never be eliminated but only managed. </p>
            <h2>Critical period of weed control</h2>
            <p> This period has been defined as an interval in the life cycle of the crop when a must be kept weed – free to prevent yield loss. If weeds have been controlled throughout the critical period, the weeds that emerge later will not affect yield and can be controlled prior to harvest with a harvest and to burn down the weeds and desiccate the crop. Horticulture crops are very sensitive to weed competition, and need to kept weed-free, from planting, emergence or budbreak, until the end of their critical weed –free period. If the crop is kept weed-free for the critical period, generally no yield reduction would result. Again, weeds emerging after the critical weed-free period will not affect yield, but control efforts after this time may make harvest more efficient, or reduce weed problems in subsequent years in perennial crops. </p>
            <h2>2. Cultural Method</h2>
            <h3>Crop rotation</h3>
            <p>Crop rotation involves alternating different crops in a systematic sequence on the same land. It is an important strategy for developing a sound long term weed control program. Weeds tend to thrive with crops of similar growth requirements as their own and cultural practices designed to contribute to the crop may also benefit the growth and development of weeds. Monoculture, that is growing the same crop in the same field yea after year, results in a build-up of weed species that are adapted to the growing conditions of the crop. When diverse crops are used in a rotation, weed germination and growth cycles are disrupted by variations in cultural practices associated with each crop (tillage, planting dates, crop competition, etc).</p>
