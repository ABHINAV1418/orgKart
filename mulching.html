        <h1>Mulching for Weed Management in Organic Vegetable Production</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Mulches contribute to weed management in organic crops by reducing weed seed germination, blocking weed growth, and favoring the crop by conserving soil moisture and sometimes by moderating soil temperature. Opaque synthetic mulches like black plastic provide an effective barrier to most weeds and are amenable to mechanized application, but they must be removed at the end of the season. Organic mulches like straw suppress annual weed seedlings, conserve moisture, and add organic matter as they break down, but they are more labor-intensive to apply. This article examines uses, advantages, and limitations of different mulching systems for weed control in organic vegetable production. Two companion articles provide additional information on organic mulches and synthetic mulches.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Mulching can reduce weed competition against vegetable crops, and save fuel and labor costs for weed control. Covering the soil surface with a suitable mulch can:
            <ol>
                <li>Reduce weed seed germination.</li>
                <li>Shade and physically hinder emerging weeds.</li>
                <li>Enhance crop growth and competitiveness by conserving soil moisture and sometimes by modifying soil temperature.</li>
            </ol>
            Synthetic mulches like black polyethylene film (the most widely used plastic mulch) or landscape fabric are laid on a prepared seedbed just before transplanting or seeding a vegetable crop through holes or slits cut into the mulch. In-row drip irrigation lines under the mulch provide water and liquid fertilizers to the crop. Mechanization, with equipment such as tractor-drawn bed shapers, mulch layers, and planters, allows the farmer to mulch and plant a multi-acre field within a single day (Fig. 1). Black plastic, other opaque materials, and infrared-transmitting (IRT) mulch effectively block weed emergence, and promote soil warming and early crop growth. Weeds emerging through planting holes may require manual removal, and alleys between mulched beds generally need cultivation or other weed control measures.<br>
