        <h1>Genetic Pest Management</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Genetic pest management (GPM) methods involve releasing modified versions of a pest species to mate with wild
            pests in the target area. Proposed for a wide range of applications in public health, agriculture and
            conservation, most progress has been made with pest insects. Offspring of the released modified insects and
            wild pests carry the modification—which might be transgenes, artificially introduced Wolbachia or genetic
            damage from radiation, for example—but they also carry a complete haploid genome from their
            laboratory-reared parent, as well as one from their wild parent. Unless these F1 hybrids are completely
            unable to reproduce, further mating will lead to introgression of DNA sequences from the release strain into
            the wild population. We discuss issues around strain selection and the potential consequences of such
            introgression. We conclude that such introgression is probably harmless in almost all circumstances, and
            could, in theory, provide specific additional benefits to the release programme. We outline population
            monitoring approaches that could be used, going forward, to determine how background genetics may affect
            GPM.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Pest insects do enormous damage to human health (through the transmission of diseases such as dengue fever
            and malaria) and to agriculture (through damage to crops or livestock). Control methods, such as the use of
            insecticidal chemicals, are highly successful. However, their continued application may become restricted by
            concerns over environmental impact, and the evolution of chemical resistance. In the light of these
            drawbacks, there has been considerable investment in applying genetics-based approaches to pest control
            [1–3]. Genetic pest management (GPM) strategies aim to harness the natural mating systems of the pest in
            order to introduce into the pest population, traits that will sterilize, kill or otherwise modify the
            population. Here, the control agent is a version of the pest itself, laboratory-reared individuals with a
            heritable modification that desirably alters its properties are released into the wild. Such GPM has been
            proposed for a wide range of pest species, with a significant focus on insects, particularly mosquitoes
            <br>While there are many inherent traits one might wish to change in a pest population, for GPM work has
            focused almost exclusively on two—fitness and vector competence. Introgression of traits such as sterility
            or lethality—reduced fitness traits—aims to reduce the numerical size of the target population, and so these
            are collectively described as ‘population suppression' traits or methods. Reduced vector competence traits,
            relevant only to vector species, aim to reduce transmission of one or more pathogens with only incidental
            effects on population size; these are ‘population modification’ methods, sometimes called ‘population
            conversion' or ‘population replacement' though the population is not typically actually replaced
            <br>By far the most widely used GPM method to date has been the sterile-insect technique (SIT) and its
            variants, in which ‘sterile' insects are released to mate with their wild pest conspecifics [4]. Introducing
            sterile insects, particularly sterile males, reduces the reproductive potential of the target population and
            with sustained releases can lead to the decline or even elimination of the target population. Sterility can
            be induced by irradiation [5–7], Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility [8–10], chemical treatment
            [11] or genetic engineering, for example, release of insects carrying a dominant lethal (RIDL) [12–15].
            <br>While much attention has focused on the novel genetic trait, the background genotype in which it is
            developed will contribute significantly to the performance of the released modified insects, for example, in
            terms of mating success. Considerably less attention has been paid to the capacity for hybridization and
            gene flow between the released modified insects and wild ones. ‘Sterilization' of males is rarely 100%
            effective, for example, because of a need to balance sterility and negative effects on performance in
            selecting radiation dose, or incomplete penetrance of genetic sterility [16,17]. Other GPM methods require
            fertile matings to allow introgression of novel traits into target populations [14]; in both cases
            introgression of background genetic material is likely. This is a relevant question as introgression of
            novel genetic variation could affect the target population and perhaps even, in theory, result in an
            increase in fitness in the target population. With the rapid development of a variety of novel strategies,
            with varying propensities for gene flow, selection of background genotype should, therefore, be a
            significant decision for a developer, and correspondingly perhaps also for regulators and other
            stakeholders.

        <h2>Population genetics of laboratory strains</h2>
        <p>Genetic differences have repeatedly been observed between laboratory colonies of mosquitoes and their source
            field populations, though their nature and magnitude vary substantially (reviewed in [18–20]). These
            laboratory insects differ from field ones owing to the combined effects of genetic drift, bottlenecking and
            selection [21]. Though the relative contribution of each has only rarely been studied [18], it is well
            recognized that laboratory strains have reduced fitness in the wild compared to their wild counterparts,
            leading to consistent concerns about the post-release performance of these strains for GPM
            <br>Laboratory-reared wild-type strains typically have low effective population sizes, because founder
            population sizes are generally small, and lines are usually maintained at relatively low numbers after that.
            These small founding populations experience elevated levels of inbreeding and genetic drift relative to wild
            populations, leading to an accelerated loss of allelic diversity and heterozygosity [23–25]. Not
            surprisingly then, laboratory strains are consistently found to be less genetically variable than their
            field counterparts [26]. Small population sizes and low levels of genetic diversity present in laboratory
            strains result in reduced individual and population fitness through inbreeding depression and loss of
            adaptive potential. As such, theory predicts that, through neutral processes alone, laboratory populations
            should be less fit than their wild counterparts, especially in a wild setting [27]. In addition to these
            demographic processes, natural selection can also have large effects on individual fitness and population
            dynamics in laboratory populations. Laboratory environments are inherently artificial and colonized insect
            populations experience a substantially different set of selective pressures compared to those in natural
            populations (reviewed in [21]). Laboratory environments lack many selective pressures typical of wild
            populations, usually being very stable (controlled temperature, humidity, light : dark cycles and controlled
            rearing schedules) and benign (lacking many biotic and abiotic threats such as predators, disease, droughts
            or food scarcity) [23,28,29]. Simultaneously, laboratory rearing protocols involve artificial selection for
            a host of traits, including faster development to reproductive maturity and a front-loaded reproductive
            period [30–32], body size [24,33,34], longevity [24], courtship [35–38], blood-feeding behaviours [39–41],
            among others
            <br>Genetic control strains probably experience even greater effects of bottlenecking and laboratory
            adaptation than laboratory-reared wild-type strains. As genetic modification is still highly inefficient,
            control strains must typically be constructed from those laboratory-adapted strains which are most
            productive in captivity. For example, after some success engineering Aedes aegypti [12,13], Oxitec—a company
            specializing in GPM technologies—attempted to develop similar strains of Aedes albopictus. With an eye to
            potential field use, they chose to start with a relatively recently colonized strain of A. albopictus,
            rather than a much older strain as had been used for A. aegypti. Successful engineering of A. albopictus was
            achieved [42,43] only after substantial improvements in strain productivity over 10 or so generations,
            attributed partly to improved methods but more to the further adaptation of the strain to laboratory
            conditions. Genetic control strains are also likely to experience a second bottleneck at their genesis,
            since they often originate from a single founder individual. This founder might carry a new transgene,
            chromosome translocation, or Wolbachia insertion. Recovering even the modest genetic diversity of a typical
            laboratory strain requires extensive backcrossing; there will be a further potential bottleneck if and when
            the strain is made homozygous, though this may not always be required. Inbreeding depression from such
            mating schemes may adversely affect the performance of the strain and potentially confound analyses of
            transgene-specific effects, e.g. fitness cost of the transgene [44]. On the other hand, one rarely
            considered aspect of genetic control strains is that they are often expanded to enormous population sizes
            for mass release. This may allow for some recovery of genetic variation through de novo mutations and
            increased recombination rates, although owing to the time scales involved it is unlikely that levels of
            genetic diversity in these populations will come close to that of wild populations. Further, rearing for
            mass-release programmes is likely to increase the strength and efficacy of adaptation to laboratory
            conditions, an issue that has long been of concern to SIT programmes [22].
