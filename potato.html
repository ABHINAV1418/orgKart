																						<p><strong>Time of sowing</strong><br />
Accurate planting time is necessary for obtaining good yield. Best time of planting is when maximum and minimum temperature is from 30-32 &deg;C and 18-20 &deg;C respectively. For early season crop complete sowing from 25th September to 10th October. For medium duration crop, sowing should be done in first week of October to third week of October. While for late duration crop, complete sowing from third week of October to first week of November.<br />
For spring season, second fortnight of January is best time planting.<br />
<strong><br />
Spacing</strong><br />
For planting, use distance of 20 cm between tubers and 60 cm between ridges manually or mechanically. Planting distance vary with size of tubers. If diameter of tuber ranges from 2.5-3.5 cm, use planting distance of 60x15 cm where as if diameter of tuber is of 5-6 cm, use spacing of 60x40 cm.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Sowing Depth</strong><br />
Dig a trench of 6-8 inch deep and plant piece of potato with eye pointing up. <br />
<br />
<strong>Method of sowing</strong><br />
For sowing, use tractor operated semi-automatic or automatic planter.<br />

																						<p><strong>Seed rate</strong><br />
Use seed rate of 8-10 qtl/acre for small size tuber, 10-12 qtl/acre for medium size and 12-18qtl/acre for large size tubers. Use whole seeds for disease free quality seed production.<br />
<br />
<strong>Seed Treatment</strong><br />
Select seed/tuber from reliable source. Choose medium size tuber of 25-125 gm weight for plantation purpose. For plantation purpose potato tuber after removing from cold storage are kept in cool and shady place for one to two weeks to allow emergence of sprouts. To get uniform sprouting, Treat tubers with Gibberellic acid@1 gm/10 ltr water for 1 hour then dry in shade and keep in aerated dim room for 10 days. Dip cut tubers in solution of 0.5% Mancozeb solution (5 gm/ltr of water) for ten minutes. It will prevent rotting of tuber in early plantation stage. To protect crop from rotting and black scurf disease treat whole and cut tubers with 6% Mercury solution (Tafasan)@0.25% (2.5 gm/ltr of water).</p>										</div>

<p>Apply 200 qtl/acre of Farm Yard Manure or well decomposed cow dung at time of land preparation two weeks before planting. For optimum growth, it required Nitrogen@75 kg per acre in form of Urea@165 kg/acre, Phosphorus@25 kg/acre in form of SSP@155 kg/acre and Potash@25 kg/acre in form of MOP@40 kg/acre.</p>
<p><br />
Apply 3/4th of nitrogen fertilizer and whole dose of phosphorus and potash at time of sowing. Remaining 1/4th dose of nitrogen should be applied after 30-40 days after planting at time of earthing up operation. In case of light soil apply half dose of nitrogen and full dose of P and K at time of sowing and remaining half should be apply as top dressing in two time in equal splits at time of earthing up operation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Earthing up:</strong> It is necessary to maintain proper aeration, proper soil temperature and moisture in soil for good growth of crop and proper development of tubers. In earthing up soil is drawn up around base of plant to encourage better tuber formation. It should be done when plant attained height of 15-20 cm. If required carry out second earthing up two weeks after first earthing up. It can be done manually with hoe or mould board plough or ridger for large areas.<br />
<br />
<strong>WSF:</strong> To promote bulking in Potato, Spray 13:0:45@ 2 kg and 100gm Magnesium EDTA per acre. Add fungicide Propineb@3 gm/ltr of water as prophylactic.

    <li><strong>Disease and their control:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Early blight</strong>: Necrotic spots observed on lower leaves. The fungus due which infestation occurred lies in soil. It rapidly spread in high moisture and low temperature.</p>
<p>Avoid mono cropping of crop and follow crop rotation. If infestation is observed, spraying of Mancozeb@30gm or Copper oxychloride@30gm/10ltr water at 45 days 2-3 times at 10 days interval should be done.</p>										</div>

																						<p><strong>Late Blight:</strong> Infestation is observed on lower part of leaves and tip of leaves. Irregular water spots are seen on infected leaves. Around the spot white powdery growth is observed. In severe condition, white powdery growth is seen on nearby soil surface of infected plants. This disease is rapidly spread in cloudy weather and after rains. If not controlled, it can cause loss up to 50%.</p>
<p>For sowing, use healthy and disease free seeds. If infestation is observed, take spray of Propineb@40gm/15Ltr of water.</p>										</div>

																				<h2 id="Harvesting"> Harvesting  </h2>
																														<div class="more">
																						<p><strong>Dehaulming:</strong> It is necessary to get virus free seed also it increases size and number of tubers. Dehaulming means cutting of foliage close to ground at fix timing or date. Its timing is varying according to region and also on aphid population. In north it is carried out in last week of December.</p>
<p>Crop is ready for harvesting when majority of the leaves turn yellow-brown and fall on ground. Harvest crop 15-20days after dehaulming at proper moisture in soil. Harvesting can be done by tractor drawn potato digger or manually with help of spade or khurpi. After harvesting potatoes are spread on ground and allowed to dry in shade, keep them in heaps for 10-15days in shade for curing of skin. Remove damaged and rotten tubers.</p>										</div>
