   <h1>What is crop rotation?</h1>
   <p>Crop rotation is an agricultural system of designing the land schedule of a certain parcel of land on what crops to be grown on that land at intervals.in designing of the land schedule on what to grow the farmer supposes to put into consideration how the soil nutrients are going to be sustained and how the pests and weeds are to be controlled naturally without interfering with the health of the soil.

    In implementing the crop rotation schedule, the farmer is supposed to take into consideration the climatic conditions that his or her area is exposed to as well as the nature of the crops that he or she is to plant. In this case therefore, it is important for farmer to be cognizant of the fact that before they plant crops that eat up the nitrogen in the soil they are supposed to plant crops that fix nitrogen in the soil, this way there will be a balance in the nitrogen levels in the soil.
    
    The main idea behind crop rotation is to ensure that the farmer plant crops at intervals that have the ability of maintaining the health of the soil so as not to use synthetic fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides in a bid to repair the soil. Because of this therefore, crop rotation is a component of organic farming because it uses natural ways instead of synthetic materials to guarantee that the soil is healthy.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Crop rotation is seen as a very important element and component of organic farming and listed below are some of the ways that crop rotation facilitates organic farming.
     <ol>
         <li>Disease and pest control</li>
         <li>Improved soil fertility and structure</li>
         <li>Control of soil erosion</li>
         <li>Control of weeds</li>
         <li>Increased yields from the farm</li>
         <li>Improves biodiversity of the soil</li>
     </ol>

    <h2>Why is crop rotation considered a component of organic farming</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crop rotation facilitates disease and pest control</li>
        <p>Root diseases and also stem diseases that affect plants can be controlled through crop rotation. To control these diseases a farmer is supposed to plant a crop that does not sustain the life of the pathogens that cause these diseases immediately after harvesting plants that support the life of those pathogens. The plants that support the life of the pathogens are called host plants while those that do not support the life are called non-host plants. A farmer is therefore supposed to rotate non-host plants after host plants in a bid to control diseases.
           The control of pests also uses the same principle of planting a non-host plant immediately after a host plant in a bid to starve the pest and ensure that they do not multiply. A farmer is therefore supposed to distinguish between a host plant and a non-host plant in order to be able manage pests and diseases using crop rotation.</p>
        <li>Crop rotation improves soil fertility and structure.</li>
        <p>Crop rotation is the most natural way of naturally maintaining the chemical properties and also the physical properties of the soil and this way ensuring that the fertility standards of the soil is guaranteed. Rotating of nitrogen fixing crops with the nitrogen using crops ensures that the nitrogen level of the soil is at the required level. In practice, a farmer is to plant a nitrogen using crop immediately after a nitrogen fixing crop so as to ensure that these two crops complement each other.</p>
        <li>Crop rotation controls soil erosion.</li>
        <p>Soil erosion greatly improves soil structure and therefore guards the soil from the effects of the two major agents of soil erosion namely; wind and water. In nature crops ensure that the effects of soil erosion are minimized by reducing the impact of the raindrops on the soil, reducing the detachment of soil sediments, reducing the speed at which water passes on the land surface and also reducing the speed of wind.</p>
        <li>Crop rotation controls weeds</li>
        <p>During a planting season a farmer is encouraged to rotate and plant cover crop in his or her field, owing to the fact that cover crops deals with weeds naturally. Cover crops act by crowding the weeds and depriving them of sunlight, space and nutrients which are very important elements in the survival of the weeds. Once the weeds have been deprived of these essential elements towards their growth their multiplication will be reduced and finally they will die off.</p>
        <li>Crop rotation increases the yields from the farm</li>
        <p>Crop rotation enables a farmer to get maximum yields at the end of a planting season. This increase in yield is as a result of the individual yields that were expected from the crops and also due to the soil fertility that is improved when the crops that are planted one after the other complement each other to guarantee maximum yield.</p>
        <li>Crop rotation improves the biodiversity of the soil</li>
        <p>Through crop rotation, the rooting pattern in the soil and the crop residue is changed. This improves the biodiversity and the fertility of the soil. The planting of different crops on the same piece of land enables the soil to support a number of organisms that improve the health and fertility of the soil.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Crop rotation largely depends on natural means of soil protection to safeguard the health of the soil, it is therefore viewed as the most important component of organic farming because it does not incorporate synthetic materials.</p>
