    <h1>Organic Fertilizers / Manures</h1>
    <p>Organic fertilizers are fertilizers that are naturally produced and contain carbon (C). Organic fertilizers
      include mineral sources, all animal waste including meat processing, manure, slurry, and guano, plant based
      fertilizers, such as compost, and biosolids. Manures are plant and animal wastes that are used as sources of plant
      nutrients. They release nutrients after their decomposition. Naturally occurring or synthetic chemicals containing
      plant nutrients are called fertilizers. Manures with low nutrient, content per unit quantity have longer residual
      effect besides improving soil physical properties compared to fertilizer with high nutrient content. Major sources
      of manures are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cattle shed wastes-dung, urine and slurry from biogas plants</li>
      <li>Human habitation wastes-night soil, human urine, town refuse, sewage, sludge and sullage</li>
      <li>Poultry Jitter, droppings of sheep and goat</li>
      <li>Slaughterhouse wastes-bone meal, meat meal, blood meal, horn and hoof meal, Fish wastes</li>
      <li>Byproducts of agro industries-oil cakes, bagasse and press mud, fruit and vegetable processing wastes etc</li>
      <li>Green manure crops and green leaf manuring material</li>
      <li>Crop wastes-sugarcane trash, stubbles and other related material </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Manures can also be grouped, into bulky organic manures and concentrated organic manures based on concentration
      of the nutrients. </p>
    <h1>Bulky organic manures </h1>
    <p>Bulky organic manures contain small percentage of nutrients and they are applied in large quantities. Farmyard
      manure (FYM), compost and green-manure are the most important and widely used bulky organic manures. Use of bulky
      organic manures has several advantages: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They supply plant nutrients including micronutrients </li>
      <li>They improve soil physical properties like structure, water holding capacity etc. </li>
      <li>They increase the availability of nutrients </li>
      <li>Carbon dioxide released during decomposition acts as a CO2 fertilizer and </li>
      <li>Plant parasitic nematodes and fungi are controlled to some extent by altering the balance of microorganisms in
        the soil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Farmyard manure</h2>
    <p>Farmyard manure refers to the decomposed mixture of dung and urine of farm animals along with litter and left
      over material from roughages or fodder fed to the cattle. On an average well decomposed farmyard manure contains
      0.5 per cent N, 0.2 per cent P2O5and .0.5 per cent K2O.The present method of preparing farmyard manure by the
      farmers is defective. Urine, which is wasted, contains one per cent nitrogen and 1.35 per cent potassium. Nitrogen
      present in urine is mostly in the form of urea which is subjected to volatilization losses. Even during storage,
      nutrients are lost due to leaching and volatilization. However, it is practically impossible to avoid losses
      altogether, but can be reduced by following improved method of preparation of farmyard manure. Trenches of size 6
      m to 7.5 m length, 1.5 m to 2.0 m width and 1.0 m deep are dug.
      <br>All available litter and refuse is mixed with soil and spread in the shed so as to absorb urine. The next
      morning, urine soaked refuse along with dung is collected and placed in the trench. A section of the trench from
      one end should be taken up for filling with daily collection. When the section is filled up to a height of 45 cm
      to 60 cm above the ground level, the top of the heap is made into a dome and plastered with cow dung earth slurry.
      The process is continued and when the first trench is completely filled, second trench is prepared.
      <br>The manure becomes ready for use in about four to five months after plastering. If urine is not collected in
      the bedding, it can be collected along with washings of the cattle shed in a cemented pit from which it is later
      added to the farmyard manure pit. Chemical preservatives can also be used to reduce losses and enrich farmyard
      manure. The commonly used chemicals are gypsum and superphosphate. Gypsum is spread in the cattle shed which
      absorbs urine and prevents volatilization loss of urea present in the urine and also adds calcium and sulphur.
      Superphosphate also acts similarly in reducing losses and also increases phosphorus content.
      <br>Partially rotten farmyard manure has to be applied three to four weeks before sowing while well rotten manure
      can be applied immediately before sowing. Generally 10 to 20 t/ha is applied, but more than 20 t/ha is applied to
      fodder grasses and vegetables. In such cases farmyard manure should be applied at least 15 days in advance to
      avoid immobilization of nitrogen. The existing practice of leaving manure in small heaps scattered in the field
      for a very long period leads toloss of nutrients. These losses can be reduced by spreading the manure and
      incorporating by ploughing immediately after application.
      <br>Vegetable crops like potato, tomato, sweet-potato, carrot, raddish, onion etc., respond well to the farmyard
      manure. The other responsive crops are sugarcane, rice, napier grass and orchard crops like oranges, banana, mango
      and plantation crop like coconut.
      The entire amount of nutrients present in farmyard manure is not available immediately. About 30 per cent of
      nitrogen, 60 to 70 per cent of phosphorus and 70 per cent of potassium are available to the first crop.

    <h2>Sheep and Goat Manure</h2>
    <p>The droppings of sheep and goats contain higher nutrients than farmyard manure and compost. On an average, the
      manure contains 3 per cent N, 1 per cent P2O5 and 2 per cent K2O.It is applied to the field in two ways. The
      sweeping of sheep or goat sheds are placed in pits for decomposition and it is applied later to the field. The
      nutrients present in the urine are wasted in this method. The second method is sheep penning, wherein sheep and
      goats are kept overnight in the field and urine and fecal matter added to the soil is incorporated to a shallow
      depth by working blade harrow or cultivator or cultivator.</p>
    <h2>Poultry Manure</h2>
    <p>The excreta of birds ferment very quickly. If left exposed, 50 percent of its nitrogen is lost within 30 days.
      Poultry manure contains higher nitrogen and phosphorus compared to other bulky organic manures. The average
      nutrient content is 3.03 per cent N; 2.63 per cent P2O5 and 1.4 per cent K2O.</p>
    <h2>Concentrated organic manures</h2>
    <p>Concentrated organic manures have higher nutrient content than bulky organic manure. The important concentrated
      organic manures are oilcakes, blood meal, fish manure etc. These are also known as organic nitrogen fertilizer.
      Before their organic nitrogen is used by the crops, it is converted through bacterial action into readily usable
      ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. These organic fertilizers are, therefore, relatively slow acting, but
      they supply available nitrogen for a longer period.</p>
    <h3>Oil cakes</h3>
    <p>
      After oil is extracted from oilseeds, the remaining solid portion is dried as cake which can, be used as manure.
      The oil cakes are of two types:
    <ol>
      <li>Edible oil cakes which can be safely fed to livestock; e.g.: Groundnut cake, Coconut cake etc., and</li>
      <li>Non edible oil cakes which are not fit for feeding livestock; e.g.: Castor cake, Neem cake, Mahua cake etc.,
      </li>
    </ol>
    Both edible and non-edible oil cakes can be used as manures. However, edible oil cakes are fed to cattle and
    non-edible oil cakes are used as manures especially for horticultural crops. Nutrients present in oil cakes, after
    mineralization, are made available to crops 7 to 10 days after application. Oilcakes need to be well powdered before
    application for even distribution and quicker decomposition.

    <h2>Other Concentrated Organic Manures</h2>
    <p>Blood meal when dried and powdered can be used as manure. The meat of dead animals is dried and converted into
      meat meal which is a good source of nitrogen.  Average nutrient content of animal based concentrated organic
      manures is given as follows.</p>
