    <h1>Agronomic Practices</h1>
    <img src="images/agronomic.png" class="img-fluid" class="img-thumbnail" alt="">
    <p>Agronomic practices are a vital part of farming systems. These are practices that farmers incorporate to improve soil quality, enhance water usage, manage crops and improve the environment. Agronomic practices focus on better fertilizer management as a way of improving agricultural practices</p>
    <h2>Benefits of agronomic practices</h2>
    <p>Proper usage of agronomic practices, decreases input costs in producing farm products. Consequently, the quality and quantity of the yield will increase significantly. The exercises also help the farmer in taking good care of the environment by reducing pollution. Decreasing water usage and proper use of fertilizer also contribute to maintaining the quality of land.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Agronomic practices</h2>
    <p>Agronomic practices incorporate many areas of conservation. In farming any practice that entails conservation is an agronomic practice. Practices such as reducing tillage managing plant population and controlling the use of water are some of the major agronomic practices that almost every farmer has tried. The changes in agronomy might be small, but the results of using the practices are massive. These routines nonetheless have yielded major dividends that farmers have enjoyed</p>
    <h2>Some of the best practices include</h2>
    <h3>Reducing water usage</h3>
    <p>Every farm needs water for the survival of crops and every other use on the farm. Nevertheless, too much usage of water leads to wastage and can sometimes affect the soil. The farm, therefore, needs not too much water such that it’s wasted or not too little water such that the soil lacks.</p>
    <h3>Soil tillage</h3>
    <p>The soil is the most vital thing on a farm. Taking good care of it means that the crops will do well and the soil won’t lose fertility. In a farm, one needs to practice minimum methods of soil tillage. Minimum soil tillage will increase the water retention capability of the soil as well as maintain its fertility. Maintaining the soil also entails the good use of fertilizer. This will not only take care of the soil but the environment as well.</p>
    <h3>Manage plant populations</h3>
    <p>Each farmer wants to ensure that they get a bumper harvest. Nevertheless, it is also vital that they ensure their harvest is of quality and not just quantity. Controlling plant population is, therefore, the best way of ensuring crops do well. Managing the population ensures that they are not over crowded such that they compete for nutrients or under crowded such that the input is under-utilized. The plants have to grow in prime growing conditions.</p> 
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Agronomic practices are efficient and very useful to a farmer. For a commercial farmer, the practices will enable the farmer to get good profits while taking care of the environment. To a domestic farmer, the practices are a cheap method of maintaining your farming </p>
