																						<p>The botanical name of Sweet potato is Ipomoea batatas. This crop is mainly grown because of its sweet taste and starchy roots. The tubers are rich source of beta-carotene and are used as anti-oxidants. It is an herbaceous perennial vine having lobed or heart shaped leaves. Its tubers are edible, smooth skin, tapered and long. It has wide color range of tuber skin i.e. purple, brown, white and purple which contains wide range of flesh i.e. yellow, orange, white and purple. In India about 2 lakh of land is under cultivation of sweet potatoes. In Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa are the major growing states in India.</p>										</div>

																						<p>It is grown in variety of soil types ranging from sandy to loamy soil, but it gives best result when grown under sandy loam soil having high fertility and good drainage system. Avoid cultivation of sweet potato in very light sandy and heavy clayey soil as it is not good for tuber development. It requires pH ranging from 5.8-6.7 is best for sweet potato cultivation.</p>										</div>

																														<div class="more">
																						<p>For sweet potato plantation, the land should be well prepared. To bring the soil to the fine tilth, before sowing land must be ploughed 3-4 times followed by planking&rsquo;s. The field should be weed-free.</p>										</div>

																		<article class="crop-info-repeater ">
																				<h2 id="Sowing"> Sowing </h2>
																														<div class="more">
																						<p><strong>Time of sowing: </strong><br />
For optimum yield, tubers should be sown in nursery beds in the month of January to February and the optimum time for planting vines in the field is in the month of April to July.<br />
<br />
<strong>Spacing: </strong><br />
Use row to row spacing of 60cm and plant to plant spacing of 30cm.<br />
<strong><br />
Sowing depth: </strong><br />
Use depth of 20-25cm for tuber planting.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method of sowing:</strong><br />
Mainly propagation is done by tubers or vine cuttings. In vine cutting method (commonly used), the tubers are taken from the old vines and planted on prepared nursery beds.&nbsp; Mainly vines are planted in ridges or on prepared flat beds. It is seen that terminal cuttings gives better result. The host plant must have at least 4 nodes. Row spacing of 60cm and within row spacing of 30cm is used. Before planting it is better to treat the cuttings with DDT 50% solution for 8-10 minutes.</p>										</div>

																				<h2 id="Seed"> Seed </h2>
																														<div class="more">
																						<p><strong>Seed rate:</strong><br />
Use 25,000-30,000 of vines cutting in per acre land. Sowing of 35-40kg tubers in half a kanal land is done for raising vines in February to March month. Vines are then planted in the main fields in one acre land. <br />
<strong><br />
Seed treatment:</strong><br />
Place the tubers in plastic bag and then soak them in concentrated sulphuric acid for 10-40 minutes.<br />
