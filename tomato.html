				<p>Tomato is originated in Peru of South America. It is important commercial vegetable crop of India. It
					is the second most important crop of world after potato. Fruits are eaten raw or in cooked form. It
					is rich source of vitamin A, C, potassium and minerals. It is used in soup, juice and ketch up,
					powder. The major tomato producing states are Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra,
					Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. In Punjab state, Amritsar, Ropar, Jalandhar,
					Hoshiarpur are tomato growing districts.</p>

			<div class="more">
				<p>For tomato plantation, it required well pulverise and levelled soil. To bring soil to fine tilth,
					plough land for 4-5times, then planking is done to make soil level. At time of last ploughing add
					well decomposed cow dung and Carbofuron@5kg or Neem cake@8kg per acre should be applied.
					Transplantation of tomato is done on raised bed. For that prepared raised bed of 80-90cm width. To
					destroy harmful soil borne pathogen, pest and organism, soil solarization is carried out. It can be
					done by using transparent plastic film as mulch. This sheet absorb radiation and thus increases soil
					temperature and kill pathogen.</p>

					<br />
					10-15days after transplanting sprayed 19:19:19 along with micronutrients@2.5 to 3gm/Ltr of water. To
					make plants healthier and stronger and to harden seedling against transplanting sock take spray of
					Lihocin@1ml/Ltr water at 20days after sowing. Damping Off damages crop to great extent, to prevent
					crop from it avoid overcrowding of seedlings and keep soil wet. If wilting is observed, do drenching
					of Metalaxyl@2.5gm/Ltr water, 2-3 times till plants are ready for transplantation.<br />
					<br />
					Seedling is ready for transplantation 25 to 30days after sowing with 3-4leaves. In case if seedlings
					age is more than 30days transplant it after de-toping. Water seedling beds 24hours before
					transplanting so that seedlings can be easily uprooted and be turgid at transplanting time.<br />
					<br />
					To protect crop from bacterial wilt, dip seedlings in 100ppm Streptocycline solution for 5 minutes

					April -May.<br />
					<strong><br />
						Spacing</strong><br />
					Depending upon variety use and its growth habit, use spacing of 60x30cm or 75x60cm or 75x75cm. In

					<strong>WSF: </strong>10-15days after transplanting, take spray of 19:19:19 along with
					micronutrient@2.5 to 3gm/ltr of water. Due to low temperature, plant absorbs fewer nutrients and

					Obtain good fruit quality along with good yield, take spray of 12:61:00 (Mono Ammonium Phosphate)@10
					gm/Ltr before flowering.&nbsp; When flowering starts in initial days, take spray of
					Boron@25gm/10litre of water. It will help to control flower and fruit dropping.&nbsp; Sometime black
					spots are observed on fruits, these are due to calcium deficiency. Take spray of calcium
					nitrate@2gm/ltr of water. In high temperature flower drop is seen, spray with NAA@50 ppm (50ml/10L
					water) when crop is in flowering stage. Give one spray of sulphate of potash (00:00:50+18S) during
					fruit development stage@3-5 gm/ltr of water. It will give good fruit development and colour. Fruit
					cracking reduces fruit quality and lowers prices up to 20%. Take spray of chelated boron
					(Solubor)@200gm/acre/200Ltr water at fruit ripening stage. To improve plant growth, flowering and
					fruit set, spray with sea weed extract (Biozyme/Dhanzyme)@3-4 ml/Ltr water twice a month. Maintain

				<p>In winter, apply irrigation with interval of 6 to 7days and in summer month, apply with interval of

				<p><strong>White fly:</strong> The nymphs and adults of white fly suck the cell sap from the leaves and
					weaken the plants. They secrete honey dew on which black sooty mould develops on leaves. They also
					transmit leaf curl diseases.</p>
				<p>After sowing of seeds in nursery, cover bed with 400mesh nylon net or thin white cloth. It helps to
					protect seedlings from pest-disease attack. To check infestation use yellow sticky traps coated with
					grease and sticky oils. To control spread of whiteflies, uproot and destroy affected plants. In case
					of severe infestation, take spray of Acetamiprid 20SP@80gm/200Ltr of water or
					Triazophos@250ml/200litre or Profenophos@200ml/200litre of water. Repeat the spray after 15 days.

				<p>To check severity of thrips incidence, keep blue sticky traps @6-8 per acre. Also to reduce the

				<p><strong>Gram Pod borer or Heliothis armigera</strong>: It is a major pest of tomato. Crop loss due to

				<p>In case of initial infestation, handpicked grown up larvae. At early stage use HNPV or Neem
					extract@50gm/Litre of water. To control fruit borer, put 16 pheromone traps/acre at equal distance
					after 20 days of transplanting. Change lure in every 20 days interval. Destroy infested parts. If

				<p>If Infestation of yellow mite &amp; thrips is observed in field, spray of Chlorfenapyr@15ml/10Ltr,

				<p><strong>Fruit Rot:</strong> Major disease of tomato and observed due to changing weather. Water

				<p>Before sowing, do seed treatment with Tricoderma@5-10gm or Carbendazim@2gm or Thiram@3 gm/Kg of

				<p><strong>Early Blight:</strong> Common and major disease of tomato. Initially small, brown isolated

					become irregular, dark brown color with concentric ring inside spots. In severe condition,

					<br />
					If infestation of early blight is observed, take spray of Mancozeb@400gm or

				<p><strong>Wilt and Damping off:</strong> Moist and poorly drain soil causes damping off disease. It is
					soil borne disease. Water soaking and shriveling of stem occurs. Seedlings killed before emergence.
					If it appears in nursery the entire lot of seedling may get destroyed.<br />
					<br />
					To prevent root rot, drench soil with 1% Urea@100gm/10Ltr and Copper oxychloride @250gm/200Ltr
					water. To control wilt, drench nearby soil with Copper oxychloride@250gm or Carbendazim@400gm/200Ltr
					of water. Increased temperature and humidity due to watering facilitate fungal growth at roots, to

					born disease, drench soil with Carbendazim@1gm/Ltr or Bordo mix@10gm/ltr, 1 month after that apply 2
					kg Trichoderma /acre, mixed with 100kg cow dung.

				<p><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Patchy, white powdery growth appears on lower side of leaves. It

				<p>Avoid water lodging in field. Keep field clean. To control this disease, spraying with Hexaconazole
