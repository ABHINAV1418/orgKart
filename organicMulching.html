    <h1>Organic Mulching</h1>
    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>In the present situation of globalization and health awareness demand of the virtuous horticultural crops has
      increased worldwide. The increasing demand for the fruits and vegetables and market competition has forced the
      farmers to produce more and high-quality fruits and vegetables for sustaining in the international market. Use of
      organic mulching is one of the suitable methods which could help the horticultural growers to increase the
      production with good quality of produce. Looking to the water scarcity and the challenges that arise due to
      climate change, adoption of organic mulching at large scale by the Indian farmers would help the farmers to
      overcome several problems considering the advantages of organic mulching. From the findings of the several studies
      shown that mulching with organic materials increases the soil nutrients, maintains the optimum soil temperature,
      restricts the rate of evaporation from the soil surface, restricts the weed growth and prevents the soil erosion.
      It also helps to improve the soil health. Organic mulches are cheap materials; therefore, the cost of mulching is
      also economical. In this paper, an attempt has been made to overview on the various types of mulching, mulching
      techniques, benefits and limitations of mulching.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Agriculture is the mainstay of most of the rural population for their livelihood and major contributor to the
      Indian economy. Indian Agriculture is facing several challenges. It is now depending on the heavy use of
      fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation and several agricultural inputs, which are constantly degrading and polluting
      the quality of soil, water and our environment. The farmers use excess doses of fertilizers and pesticides to
      increase the yield of the crop but these over doses of fertilizers and other chemicals are hazardous for our soil
      health. Also, the application of excessive irrigation water is causing the problems of soil erosion and salinity
      etc. The availability of water for agricultural use has decreased day by day due to the increased demand of the
      industrial and domestic sectors particularly in developing countries. In India, the agriculture sector is the
      prime (81%) consumer of water in which it is used mostly for irrigation purpose. During last few years,
      groundwater levels have been dropped by 0.5 to 1 m below the ground surface in the many parts of the country. The
      large variation in the temporal-spatial variation in rainfall is observed any several regions of the country are
      experiencing the drought. Improving the water use efficiency without increasing cost of production is an ongoing
      goal in crop production system. Hence, more resourceful and well-organized use of water in farm needs to be the
      top most priority. The population of the country is increasing day by day for which more production of food grains
      is required for feeding the huge population. However, due to these reasons, natural resources (like soil and
      water) are being constantly under pressure and requires a systematic and precise approach to increase the
      productivity of agricultural crops. Considering the above, several questions arise in the mind namely How to
      increase the productivity of agriculture without using the excess fertilizers and chemicals? How to minimize the
      degradation of soils? How to conserve the moisture in the soil? How to control the weeds in our fields? How to add
      nutrients to our soils?<br>
    In order to minimize degradation of soils, water and other natural resources and for environmental protection, we should adopt the conservation practices. These are more essential to obtain sustained and consistent yields, conservation of soil, water and other natural resources. The sustained yield of the crop is achieved by the conservation of soil and water adopting conservation farming. Mulching is one of the conservation practices by which these goals can be achieved. The word mulch has derived from the Germanic term “mulch” means soft to decay, which apparently referred to the use of organic materials and agricultural wastes (like straw, grass clippings, compost and leaves) spread over the ground as mulch.1 A mulch is natural or artificially spread layer of plant residues or other material on the surface of the soil. The important objectives of mulching in agriculture are namely moisture conservation, temperature control, prevention of surface compaction, reduction of runoff and erosion, improvement in soil structure and weed control. The improvement of the soil means improvement in the soil structure, increase in water holding capacity, moisture conservation, improvement in soil drainage property. Use of organic mulches prevents the soil erosion and moderate’s the soil temperature, provides nutrients to the plants as it slowly composts, giving plants a season-long feeding and the landscape as it directly defeats the pathogens and pests, enhances beneficial organisms, neutralizes pollutants. It also affects the humans in the case of economic, aesthetic, and ease of operation and in ease of weeding. Application of mulch is the magic to any garden or orchard, especially during a drought period. Similarly, it is very useful for garden or orchard in semi-arid and arid regions. It works as an insulator which cools and moderates the soil temperature during hot days and cold nights. It enhances the beneficial microbial activity and helps in fighting disease. It also restricts the evaporation of moisture from the field. It prevents soil moisture from the direct solar radiation and air flow across the soil surface, which results in lower losses of soil moisture. Evaporation of moisture from the surface of the soil is greatly distressed crop water use efficiency. The evaporation from soil surface was accounted 25-50 percentage of total evapotranspiration of crop land.
    Several researchers reported that the mulching with agricultural waste such as straw, compost, grass clippings and leaves, etc. had increased the water retention and prevented the soil evaporation.
    Higher water use efficiency would help to decrease the cost of production. In addition to this, mulching practices also help to restore the soil health with its physical, chemical and biological properties, it creates a suitable atmosphere for earthworms and other beneficial micro-organisms to grow on the soil. Weed seedlings cannot survive under the mulched condition and avoid the use of chemical weedicides. The multiple effects contribute towards the increase in the yield up to 50-60 percent under rainfed conditions.

    <h2>Types of mulches and its suitability</h2>
    <p>There are many types of mulch materials like natural, synthetic, petroleum, conventional, inorganic and organic mulches. But generally, they are classified as organic mulch and inorganic mulch. Organic mulches that are found in nature and can be broken down by soil organisms due to decomposition whereas, inorganic mulches are man-made material or anything like a rock that cannot be broken down by soil organisms. Organic mulches more beneficial than inorganic mulches. Choice of organic or inorganic mulch mainly depend on the user but the using an organic mulch means utilizing a material available in the field and it might be degraded and breaks down into organic matter. Organic mulch adds the nutrient in the soil and increases soil fertility. Inorganic mulches, like plastic sheets, are easy for handling and look a good choice due to its durability, but are non-recyclable and are not environment-friendly.</p>
    <h2>Organic mulch</h2>
    <p>Organic mulches are those natural origin materials which can decompose naturally, like agricultural wastes which are used as mulch, such as bark chips, grass clippings, wheat or paddy straw, plant leaves, compost, rice hulls, and sawdust, etc. It decays over time and it increase the water holding capacity of soil. It also provides the soil with nutrients as it breaks down. It also improves water use efficiency indirectly. A mulched layer restricts the weed growth by obstructing light penetration to the soil surface.Lower weed prevalence significantly improves water use efficiency. However, among organic materials, there is a wide range of choices each with different characteristics and suitability for different growing conditions. The total production of organic waste by human, livestock and crops are approximately 38 trillion metric tons worldwide, and about 600 to 700 million metric tons of agricultural wastes (as well as 272 million metric tons of crop residues) are existing every year in India, but most of the remains unutilized.Some of the organic mulching materials which are commonly used are described below.</p>
    <h2>Bark</h2>
    <img src="images/barkMulching.jpg" class="img-fluid" class="img-thumbnail" alt="">
    <p>These are good mulch materials because they contain more moisture and retains this moisture for longer periods and helps in the supply of moisture to the growing crop. It is commonly used for vegetation and landscaping, it should be avoided to use in vegetable fields because it is acidic. However, these mulches (fig.1) are excellent for cover the paths between beds.There are two types of bark mulch namely hardwood and softwood</p>
    <h3>Bark (Hardwood)</h3>
    <p>Hardwood bark mulches are one of the common mulches used in countryside plantings. It is a byproduct of the paper and wood industries which can be recycled as a mulch. Hardwood bark contains more nutrients than softwood bark, but they are not available easily. The pH of these types of barks is slightly alkaline. Bark (Softwood): Softwood barks are tough to decay than hardwood barks. Its pH is acidic in its reaction. These barks are available in various sizes which fits in many countryside needs.</p>
    <h3>Grass Clipping</h3>
    <p>Grass clipping is one of the most easily and abundantly available mulching material in Indian agriculture. If fresh grass clippings are used in the field, it decomposes easily and increases the percentage of nitrogen in the soil. The different types of grass clipping are widely available such as green or fresh and dry grass. Normally, green grass clippings are not used in the rainy season because it may chance to the development of its own root systems which will be harmful to crop growth. Apply of green clippings can heat up quite a bit and possibly cause damage to plants. So, always the dried grass always preferred to use as mulch. Apply to a depth of 2-3 inches.</p>
    <h3>Dry Leaves</h3>
    <img src="images/dryleavesOrganicMulching.jpg" class="img-fluid" class="img-thumbnail" class="image" alt="">
    <p>Leaves are beneficial for soil it contributes nutrients when used as mulch. It is widely used in natural forest areas and where trees are plentiful. Dry leaves are the easily and abundantly available and it makes a better mulch if it composted. However, dry leaves are not easily available in the spring season, they are valued as over­winter mulch. To restricts the blowing of dry leaves, small branches and wood barks are kept over the dry leaves mulch. The thickness of the dry leaves mulching is about 3-4 inches.</p>
    <h3>Straw</h3>
    <img src="images/strawMulching.jpg" class="img-fluid" class="img-thumbnail" class="image" alt="">
    <p>Straw (fig.4) is ideal for mulching because it is easily applying infield, stays in place and reflects sunlight which helps to bear fruit in some vegetables. It is used as winter protection and as a summer mulch in vegetable fields. These mulches provide great insulation, water penetration and weed control. The main advantageous property is that it does not contain weed seeds itself.  Straw mulches are avoided to use in high traffic areas due to its highly inflammable properties. The thickness of the straw mulching is about 6 ­ 8 inches.</p>
    <h3>Compost/Manure </h3>
    <img src="images/compostMulching.jpg" class="img-fluid" class="img-thumbnail" class="image" alt="">
    <p>The compost is good mulch and soil conditioner it can easily prepare or formed at home by composting of different types of waste materials like leaves, straw, grass and plant residues, etc. The availability and application of compost in Indian agriculture is old age practice. It improves the soil properties like physical, chemical and biological properties and enhances the carbon content which improves the water retention capacity of the soil. Compost is the good material for improving the soil health. It should not be used in the vegetable field because they have too much nitrogen and it may contain weed seeds. The excellent use of compost is at the time of bed preparation or as ‘top dressing’ thinly in the early part of the season. It used as a mulch in some nutrient loving plants like roses. Apply at a depth of 3-4 inches.</p>
    <h3>Sawdust </h3>
    <img src="images/sawDust.jpg" class="img-fluid" class="img-thumbnail" class="image" alt="">
    <p>Sawdust is a very common type of mulch in areas where easily available. It is found during the finishing operations of wood, it has less nutritive values and it has only half of nutrients than straw. Due to high C: N ratio, the decomposition is very late. Its decay will cause deficiency of nitrogen in the soil, so regular fertilizer application is necessary. Its nature is acidic, so it should not be used in acidic type of soils. However, it retains moisture for longer periods.</p>
    <h3>Newspaper</h3>
    <img src="images/newspaper.jpg" class="img-fluid" class="img-thumbnail" class="image" alt="">
    <p>Newspaper mulching helps to control weeds and is readily available. The newspaper layer biodegrades into the soil in a small time. The newspaper is better than plastic because it will eventually decompose. Newspaper mulch can save a lot of time and effort, in fields where weeds are already matured in the previous season and dropped seeds will be germinate in the coming season. However, the usage of newspaper mulches is avoided in high windy areas. The combined sheets of 2 or more sheets of newspaper should be used and its edges should be pasted with heavy materials to safety from blowing like pebbles, gravels, etc. Commonly, use of glossy paper in vegetable fields should be avoided because the ink could leach into the soil.</p>
