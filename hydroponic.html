    <h1>Hydroponic System</h1>
    <p>New technologies are coming up every day in the world. As the world population is growing, the agriculture industry is also developing new techniques to grow food in lesser space and by saving water. The hydroponic growing system is a step towards this.<br>
        Hydroponic System is a system of growing crops without soil, often called soilless farming. In the hydroponic system, the plant roots grow in a liquid nutrient solution or inside the moist inert materials like Rockwool and Vermiculite. The liquid nutrient solution is a mixture of essential plant nutrients in the water.<br>
        The plant roots are suspended either in the static liquid solution or in a continuously flowing nutrient mixture. The hydroponic growing system requires continuous attention to the crops, unlike the traditional farming system.</p>
    <h2>Advantages of a hydroponic system</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher productivity than the traditional farming system, the plant nutrients are effectively used, and there is no wastage.</li>
            <li>The hydroponic system is a controlled climate system in which the crops can grow year-round.</li>
            <li>Water is utilization very high when compared to the traditional farming method, up to 80-90 percent higher.</li>
            <li> The crops are grown in a closed space, which eliminates the attack of pests and insects.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Types of hydroponic system</h2>
    <p>The growing methods for each type of crop can be different so as the hydroponic system. When you are choosing between the various hydroponic systems, knowing about the basics of that system will help you in making the decision.<br>
        Here is a quick go through some of the hydroponic systems:</p>
        <h2>Standing Aerated Nutrient Solution: </h2>
        <p>This system is commonly known as DWC (deep water culture) system. Standing aerated nutrient solution is a hydroponic system in which the nutrient solution is static, suspending the plant roots in the nutrient solution. Replacement of nutrient solution is required every 5 to 10 days (frequency depends on the number of plants and system volume).


            A crop like lettuce can be successfully grown in this system on Styrofoam sheets floating on an aerated nutrient solution.

            <h2>Nutrient Film Technique (NFT):</h2>
            <p>Nutrient Film Technique, gully channels are used in this system to grow plants, the nutrient solution keeps flowing in these gully channels. A pump connected to the reservoir pumps the nutrient solution to the NFT channels.

                One of the advantages of the NFT is the easy installation of the system and the relatively low cost of the materials<br>
                There are two different types of NFT system:
            <ol>
                <li>Horizontal NFT System</li>
                <li>Vertical NFT System</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Aeroponic System:</h2>
        <p>Aeroponic System drastically reduces the amount of water used in growing crops. In this system, plant roots get their nutrients and water through the aerosol mist sprayed on them. Plant roots get the oxygen from the air while suspending. 
            <br>Aeroponic System is comparatively challenging to manage but much more economical in the use of nutrients and water.
